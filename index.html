<p class="text-muted">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

    <p class="text-muted">This restaurant looks like a low key diner from the outside...and then you enter into this lovely dining space filled with good aromas. We are our best meal in Norway here: delicious fish soup, mussels and salmon tartare (that our daughter loved with the capers). The baccalao and gratined stock fish were excellent, as were the hamburgers (the owners/chef source the meat then butcher and make the burgers themselves and you can taste the difference).
      Delicious desserts. If I had to pick one restaurant, I world definitely recommend Lofotmat for well prepared, seasonal food. And, the owner/chef Siv Hilde is a lovely person!

  <p>This film is the pure definition of an emotional roller coaster and throughout it's run time brings about fascination, humor, sadness, incredible excitement, and sheer finality. This is not your typical superhero movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action style of the previous films may be disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations. The film's storytelling is some of the best ever seen in blockbuster filmaking, combining smart writing, intimate character moments, and exceptional world building to create one of the best blockbuster stories ever. The superheroes are all brilliantly acted and well written, with Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johannson, and Chris Evans in particular turning in some of the most human and enduring acting preformances I have ever seen. In addition, Josh Brolin once again proves utterly breathtaking as Thanos, and he somehow feels even more intimidating and horribly insane than he was in Infinity War. Further proving that Thanos is definitely among the very best movie villains of the last century. The action is honestly some of the finest in the history of cinema. The world renowned final battle of this film is riveting, heartbreaking, awe inspiring, and exceptionally well choreographed. Never before have I been so thoroughly moved and elated while watching a battle scene in film. The film's soundtrack is also one of the best of it's kind and brilliantly complements the action. It is filled with some of the most stunning, blood pumping, and epic music themes you will EVER hear. And while the time travel elements (as with all time travel movies) are certainly questionable, as long as you don't spend a week thinking about them they most likely will not bother you. This is my favorite movie of all time (yes I do watch other movies too) and I don't think anything will ever top the experience of watching this movie opening night in the theatre. However even upon second viewings the film remains an utter blast to watch with tons of replay value due to the many eastereggs to previous films. Smart, beautiful, epic, and timeless this is a superhero masterpiece!</p>

  <p>The following are my personal opinions and review of 2019 remake of The Lion King. I have kept it as spoiler-free as possible.

    I haven’t had the fortune of watching the 1994 original The Lion King or the 2012 3D re-release in theaters, but I still remember watching the it on Television after it was digitally re-mastered. From then on, it has been on my top favourite list. I have watched the movie again and again and still cherish the experience. 
    
    Jon Favreau’s The Jungle Book (2016) was an absolute treat! And the moment I came to know about him taking on The Lion King, I was super excited. Jon Favreau’s vision regarding this film has been very clear from the beginning. He wanted to take his Photo-realistic CGI technology he used in The Jungle Book to the next level making his  film look almost as real as a BBC/Discovery Nature Documentary, and he has made it happen. Visually, The Lion King is a majestic and breathtaking experience. If a person isn’t aware of the technology used in the film, s/he will completely be convinced of the film being live action and the characters and scenarios being real. The hard-work of Favreau and the Visual effects team has paid off well. They deserve a standing ovation for this. 
    
    Does the realism of the characters feel as a compromise on the facial expressions and stunts like we had in the animated one? Well, it does. In the traditionally animated movie, animals could be made to give human like profound expressions and perform actions and stunts which isn’t seen in real life. And this film has focused on realism as the defining factor. Thus, making animals show those facial expressions, dance around and perform stunts like they did in animated classic isn’t possible.
    
    Coming to the  story, it has been more or less the same. Some liberation have been taken, there are some scenes removed and some new scenes added. Even a few characters have been modified. While some changes are welcomed, there are a few aspects that I wish were kept same like original.
    
    The background score and music by Hans Zimmer is an upgrade on the original which stays grounded to the soul of the original and further builds upon it. Certain renditions felt even more intense and impactful. Songs composed by Tim Rice and Elton John are more or less the same like the original and Beyonce has done a great job, her rendition of new song Spirit is a soulful piece. Be prepared has been cut short and re-written, but feels adequate according to the film’s situation and script changes.
    
    Coming to the voiceover, James Earls Jones reprises his role as Mufasa, with Donald ‘Childish Gambino’ Glover as Simba (JD McRary as young Simba), Beyonce Knowles Carter as Nala (Shahadi Wright Joseph as young Nala), Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar, Alfre Woodward as Sarabi, John Kani as Rafiki, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen as Timon and Pumbaa, John Oliver as Zazu, and Florence Kasumba, Keegan-Michale Key and Eric Andre as Shenzi, Azizi and Kamari. The performances of voice-over cast are good.
     Zazu, Timon and Pumbaa have a great comic timing in the film and really make it entertaining. 
    
    Overall it’s an engaging, fun and entertaining visual treat which should definitely be experienced at Theaters.</p>
